	2. Uninstall

	3. Why autoconf for such a small program ?

	4. What about RPMs



1. Configure-Build-Install

Just type the following three in series in order to install this program:

	./configure
	make
	make install

If you want the program to reside in a different location from /usr/local
(/bin and /share) then provide configure with a prefix:

	./configure --prefix=/opt

This will install the binary in /opt/bin and the data files in 
/opt/share/intel2gas.



2. Uninstall

You don't want to, it's a great program :) No really, just type 

	make uninstall

and it will be gone for good. (For god's sake, it's so small as well, you
might as well leave it on there ;)




3. Why autoconf for such a small program ?

It is always good to autoconf. It gives people a feeling of security :) In
addition, the install path needs to be configured by substitution in the
source code and not all of us are good at writing sed / awk scripts.




4. What about RPMs

You can make an RPM package from the .tar.gz with the following command:
rpm -tb intel2gas-xx-.tar.gz
The final package should appear to /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.

This works with any package which has a .spec file in the main directory
of the tarball.
